fst is a Common Lisp interface to libcfsm.

It uses the ASDF utility for loading and needs
the modules acl-compat (http://www.cliki.net/ACL-COMPAT)
and cffi (http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/).

fst has been tested in Clozure CL, Allegro CL and SBCL.

You should adapt the paths in load-fst.lisp to your environment.

See the file examples.lisp for example code.

There is a problem with s function name clash between ccl and fst:

So, to be able to run cl-fst in ccl you have to recompile the Clozure kernel:


Make sure there is no --export-dynamic in the Makefile:

instead of this:

lisp-kernel/linuxx8664/Makefile:        $(CC)  -m64 $(CDEBUG)  -Wl,--export-dynamic $(HASH_STYLE) 

this:

lisp-kernel/linuxx8664/Makefile:        $(CC)  -m64 $(CDEBUG) $(HASH_STYLE)

Then rebuild with make.
